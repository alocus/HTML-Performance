## DNS Prefetching
`<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="//example.com">`

browsers to start prefetching the DNS for that domain a fraction before it's actually needed.

## Preconnect
`<link rel="preconnect" href="http://css-tricks.com">`

the browser can set up the necessary sockets ahead of time and eliminate the costly DNS, TCP, and TLS roundtrips from the critical path of the actual request.

`<link rel="prefetch" href="image.png">`

Unlike DNS prefetching, we're actually requesting and downloading that asset and *storing it in the cache*. This is a low priority fetch and the main use case is to speed up the next navigation rather than the current one.

Use when:
- require resources in cache
- fetch resources on other pages


## Prerendering pages
`<link rel="prerender" href="http://css-tricks.com">`

This is like opening the URL in a hidden tab â€“ all the resources are downloaded, the DOM is created, the page is laid out, the CSS is applied, the JavaScript is executed, etc.

*Not supported by most browser*
*Can't use Chrome devtool to check*
